### Hello, thanks for dropping by.
Currently, I work on making robots behave more intelligently through machine learning. 

Some of my research artifacts are here, along with code nuggets from my side projects and undergraduate times. Feel free to contact me for questions, opportunities for collaboration, or just musings on the future of robotic learning.
