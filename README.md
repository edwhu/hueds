### Hello, thanks for dropping by.
I'm trying to make robots act more intelligently. Here's a short list of the research themes I'm exploring.

- Robotics
  - Manipulation: Objects are diverse in all sorts of properties: shape, color, deformability, functionality, etc. Is ML the key to handling such variability?
  - Transfer Learning: We have trained a model on one robot / environment / task. How can we transfer it to new situations?
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Model-based RL: How can we train predictive models and leverage them for control?
  - Sample-efficient Exploration: Slow and inefficient data collection is a core issue for robot learning. How can we efficiently explore the environment to autonomously collect interesting data?
