### Hello, thanks for dropping by.
Currently, I'm trying to make robots act more intelligently.

#### Interests:
- Robotics
  - Manipulation: Objects are diverse in all sorts of properties: shape, color, deformability, functionality, etc. Is ML the key to handling such variability?
  - Transfer Learning: We have trained a model on one robot / environment / task. How can we transfer it to new situations?
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  - Model-based RL: How can we train predictive models and leverage them for control?
  - Exploration: A core issue for robot learning. How can we autonomously collect informative data?
